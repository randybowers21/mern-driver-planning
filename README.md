4. View plans all plans for a specific driver.
5. Tracks total miles planned on the driver and the truck for the week.

## What I've Learned
This was a good project for me because it will help our team with keeping track of drivers and their miles. We currently use a spreadsheet and the data isn't persistent past two weeks.

I now have a better understanding of Redux than I did and wish I knew it going in to this project. I will have to refactor a lot of the redux in this because I am fetching data at the wrong times and I now know that after watching more videos on it.

I was able to work with a bunch of new technologies React Router, Redux, and moment JS. It was particularly good with Moment and React Router. The tutorials I had been using were using an older version of React Router so I had to go to documentation to get new information and apply it.

I had never worked with Moment either and had to consult the docs myself as well. 

This was the first time I branched out and tried Material UI for myself and it was tough because I still need to work on Styling and making better looking projects. But their documentation is easy to work with and understand.
